# 🧩 Chertia Requiem

### 🧩 **Chertia Requiem**

Chertia Requiem is a Roleplay survival multiplayer server (SMP) focused on gods, magic, and monsters. On the server, every one of your actions is also the action of your character. Want to stir up chaos with a mischievous character? Dream of running a cozy inn, offering refuge to weary travelers? Or perhaps you see yourself as a wandering nomad, exploring every corner of the world? The possibilities are endless.

### 🪄 Features

Chertia Requiem takes place in a large world map known as Luminara _(see the full world information_ [_here_](lore/the-world-of-divian.md)_)._ The server features a custom chat system with options for local chat messages (which will be sent only to players in a particular radius), in-character and out-of-character messages using formatting (messages with parentheses will be sent out-of-character), and more. Additionally, the server features a character system, custom items, a magic system, a virtual & physical economy, a prison-like quarry area, custom fishing, unique structures and dungeons, player-instanced loot chests, and more.
