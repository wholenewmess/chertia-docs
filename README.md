# 🧩 Chertia Requiem

### 🧩 **Chertia Requiem**

Chertia Requiem is a Roleplay SMP focused on gods, magic, and monsters. On the server, every one of your actions is also the action of your character. Want to stir up chaos with a mischievous character? Dream of running a cozy inn, offering refuge to weary travelers? Or perhaps you see yourself as a wandering nomad, exploring every corner of the world? The possibilities are endless.

### 🪄 Features

Several mechanics return from Chertia Wilds, such as runes and the quarry. The world map is much larger than previous seasons. Additionally, Chertia Requiem features a brand new custom chat system, capable of empowering both small and large roleplay sessions. For example, local chat scope allows you to send messages within a certain radius, while still providing shortcuts (such as `@whisper` and `@a`) for quick actions.
