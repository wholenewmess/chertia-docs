# 🧩 Chertia Requiem

### 🧩 Announcing **Chertia Requiem!**

Chertia returns! In early 2026, we'll begin our 8th season: Chertia Requiem. Although we're still working out many of the details, this wiki will act as the hub for information on the upcoming season and will be updated frequently.&#x20;

Our target launch date is `end of January 2026`. _**This may change.**_ We have lots to do leading up to our launch date, including the server code, defining the character creation/submission process, outlining the story, designing many of the story characters, advertising the server, creating builds, and more. Many of these things may require the community's help!

### 📖 Characters & Story

As with previous seasons, your time on the server will be entirely in-character. Want to stir up chaos with a mischievous character? Dream of running a cozy inn, offering refuge to weary travelers? Or perhaps you see yourself as a wandering nomad, exploring every corner of the world? The possibilities are endless.

This season will feature an expanded cast of story characters. Some, like Kaijin and Linumi, will return from Chertia Wilds. Although we hope to continue weekly story events, there may be more gaps than there were in previous seasons to allow for higher-quality events and to balance time commitments. Rest assured that there will be plenty of opportunities for roleplay and character interaction outside of events - it's a priority!

### 🪄 Features

Several mechanics will return from Chertia Wilds, such as runes and the quarry. The world map will be much larger than previous seasons, and players will be encouraged (but not forced) to build within a certain range. I would expect that some features will be re-added or introduced over time rather than present immediately at launch; this allows us to focus on some of the more crucial elements first while still leaving room for cool additions down the road.

Additionally, key pieces of feedback have been taken into account. Character races won't have any specific mechanics; these will instead be tied to a different system. Our custom implementation of the Mending enchantment will be modified to make it more similar to vanilla Minecraft. The chat system (which I personally believe is the best of its kind) is being re-written by Sovde with the same mechanics in mind.&#x20;

### 🧩 Coming soon!

There's still a lot to do; our issue tracker is full of things that we haven't even started to seriously think about yet. This announcement is a bit of a Chertmas gift. Expect some Community Panels in the near future and requests for help with things like building and character sheet feedback.&#x20;

That said... welcome back!
