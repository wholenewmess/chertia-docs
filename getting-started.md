# ðŸ‘‹ Getting Started

### Welcome to Chertia! <a href="#wiki_.1fab6_character_guide" id="wiki_.1fab6_character_guide"></a>

We're very happy to have you. Our Server Guide serves as a helpful tool for getting started, but this page is intended to lay everything out in a step-by-step manner to make everything easy to understand.

### 1. Join the Discord server.

Join our Discord [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://discord.gg/VSPpYwW).

### 2. Read the rules.

Take a look through the rules overview on the [<mark style="color:blue;">Rules page</mark>](structure/rules.md). You don't need to read the detailed rules just yet, but you should get a general idea of our rules and what we expect from our community members.

### 3. Apply to join.

Applying to join the community is quick and easy. Access the [#join-here](https://discord.com/channels/555458092486230058/662066595035611238) channel on the Discord and copy the application format, adding in your information. If your application is automatically rejected, it means you didn't read the rules.

### 4. Create a character concept.

Make a copy of our character concept document [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h\_JFvBX57oaxKLt\_CkxNXCv6o2SLY72CHfeNloC88zQ/edit?usp=sharing). When you're finished, you can send it to our #character-draft channel in Discord, which will become visible once you are approved to become a Community Member.

### 5. Listen to feedback and adjust your concept.

Various people, like Storytellers and staff members, may provide you with feedback about your character. Listen to the feedback and adjust your character. People who are steadfast in their unwillingness to adhere to the guidelines and culture will not succeed in this community. People who are willing to listen to others and improve their concepts will thrive. The best characters are the ones that are unique and multi-faceted - while still being yours.

### 6. Get started on the server.

Once your character is approved, you can log on to the server. Do `/character create [name]` for the character you've had approved and go from there, putting in the information from your concept document. Once you've set up your information with `/character edit`, you're good to start roleplaying. Please do NOT create your character on the server if the concept document has not been approved by a staff member. We will reset your character on the server if you do this.
