# âœ¨ Devotion

Chertia's devotion system allows your character to form relationships with the gods. Here's how it works:

* By interacting with and befriending the gods, your character will gain "favour points" (FP).
* Your character can gain FP for Linumi, Kaijin, or "rogue" FP.
* If over 50% of your character's FP is allocated to one particular god, your character becomes _devoted_ to that god. This will have more implications later.
* FP is not visible to you or your character, but devotion is noted on the character card.
* Your character _is_ aware if they become devoted to a god (they feel a "connection" with the god).
