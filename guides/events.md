# 📅 Events

### 📖 Story Events

Story events are set up by staff members. During story events, your character typically interacts with story characters (controlled by staff) to progress Chertia's main story. These events can include excursions to new locations, boss fights, puzzles, and more.

You can view an overview of our Story Events in the Discord [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://discord.com/channels/555458092486230058/1084542974400151664).

### 👥 Roleplay Events

Roleplay events are held on an irregular basis. There are no story characters during these events, and they typically serve as a simple way to get people online. Players are encouraged to roleplay with people they don't typically roleplay with.
