# 📅 Events

### 📖 Story Events

Story events are set up by staff members. During story events, your character typically interacts with story characters (controlled by staff) to progress Chertia's main story. These events can include excursions to new locations, boss fights, puzzles, and more.

You can view an overview of our Story Events in the Discord [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://discord.com/channels/555458092486230058/1084542974400151664).

### 👥 Roleplay Events

Roleplay events are held on an irregular basis. There are no story characters during these events, and they typically serve as a simple way to get people online. Players are encouraged to roleplay with people they don't typically roleplay with.

### 📝 Player Events

We love when players use Chertia as a way to express their creativity. Sometimes, players will go to great lengths to prepare and execute their own player events. To encourage this, we have set up a simple process that allows staff members to communicate with players setting up their own events. We have a few guidelines and requests for these events.

* You must fill out the application form at least 1 week before your event takes place.
* Any pieces of lore must be shared with a storyteller for approval.
* Your event must be inclusive. You are able to host private events, but we ask you to invite people outside of your immediate friends too.
* Your event cannot exceed 4 hours in length.
* Your event must be respectful of server resources (no redstone clocks, flying machines, etc.).
* Chertia player events must take place on the Chertia server in a Chertia voice channel.

The application form can be found [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdea3oFnAaicApIqqnM3pHmho9RfIZpytwJ6KbUV3mnwKJXfA/viewform?usp=sf\_link).
