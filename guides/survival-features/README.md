# ðŸŒ¾ Survival Features

Chertia has a lot of custom survival features that add additional content and provide quality-of-life improvements to Minecraft. At its core, Chertia is still a Minecraft survival server, with:

* No keep-inventory or inventory restoration.
* No homes, warps, or `/tpa` outside of story events.

### Altered Vanilla Mechanics

* Players can right click on stairs, slabs, or carpets (or run `/sit`) to sit down.
* Only one player needs to sleep for night to pass, but other players can cancel it.
* Creeper explosions do not break blocks.
* Players can right click with a shulker box in their hand to open it.
* Players can sneak + right click with a crafting table or ender chest to open it.
* Falling into the void in the End will teleport the player to the Overworld.
* Players can eat Glowberries to glow for a brief period of time.
* **Mending** no longer repairs items with XP, but instead reduces the XP cost for repairing the item in an anvil.

### Survival Features

* _**World generation...**_
  * Datapacks enable custom world generation on the server for the Overworld, Nether and End dimensions.
  * There are lots of lootable structures. If the chest has an orange name, it means the loot inside is per-player.
* _**Recipes...**_
  * See the [Recipes](../recipes.md) page for more information.
* _**The Underdark...**_
  * Located in the Stronghold (near the Cells) is a portal to the _Underdark_, a custom dimension.
  * The only way to leave the Underdark is back through the entrance portal.
  * You cannot bring any items to the Underdark (they will be automatically dropped upon entering the portal).&#x20;
  * There is no keep-inventory or item dropping in the Underdark. If you die, your inventory will be deleted.
  * Mobs are faster and stronger in the Underdark, and can vary in size.
  * You can mine freely and loot structures (which includes trial chambers). Please continue to respect the [Survival Standards](../../rules/survival-standards.md) when it comes to structures in the Underdark.
* _**Blacksmith & item repairs...**_
  * Players can right click a Blacksmith (found around the world map) with a mineral to sell it (for **crowns**, the server's virtual economy).
  * Players can right click a Blacksmith with a damaged tool and the Blacksmith will repair it (3-12 crowns).
  * Players can right click a Blacksmith with an empty hand to purchase a Totem of Unbreaking, which will save one tool/armour piece from being destroyed.
* _**Fishing...**_
  * When you fish, you have a chance to catch 1 of 26 types of fish. This includes the normal fish (cod, salmon, etc.) but also includes unique fish (stingray, jellyfish, etc.).
  * Each fish is also given a few variables: overall quality of the fish (1 to 5 stars), length (in scale 0-100) and weight (in scale 0-100). These variables together decide the price of the fish.
  * Fish can be sold to the Fishmonger in Emberlyn -- right clicking will sell your held fish, sneaking + right clicking will sell all the fish in your inventory.
  * Since these fish don't stack, inventory space will be a concern. Our recommendation is to use bundles -- they work perfectly for this system.
* _**The Alchemist...**_
  * Located in Emberlyn, you can purchase randomized potions from the Alchemist in The Perilous Potion.
  * Benevolent potions (on the left) give positive effects while malevolent potions (on the right) give negative ones \[these are cheaper].
  * You get 4 potions (stacked!) per purchase.
  * The potions will have randomized effects, including effects not normally found in potions.
* _**Froglights...**_
  * Ochre froglights will send the player forward when stepped on.
  * Verdant froglights will send the player upward when stepped on.
  * Pearlescent froglights act like teleporters. Stand on one, make direct eye contact with another, then jump.
