# ðŸŒ¾ Survival Features

Chertia has a lot of custom survival features that add additional content and provide quality-of-life improvements to Minecraft. At its core, Chertia is still a Minecraft survival server, with:

* No keep-inventory or inventory restoration.
* No homes, warps, or `/tpa` outside of story events.

### Survival Features

* _**World generation...**_
  * Datapacks enable custom world generation on the server for the Overworld, Nether and End dimensions.
  * There are lots of lootable structures. If the chest has an orange name, it means the loot inside is per-player.
* _**Recipes...**_
  * See the [Recipes](../recipes.md) page for more information.
* _**Blacksmith & item repairs...**_
  * Players can right click a Blacksmith (found around the world map) with a mineral to sell it (for **crowns**, the server's virtual economy).
  * Players can right click a Blacksmith with a damaged tool and the Blacksmith will repair it (3-12 crowns).
  * Players can right click a Blacksmith with an empty hand to purchase a Totem of Unbreaking, which will save one tool/armour piece from being destroyed.
  * **Mending** no longer repairs items with XP, but instead reduces the XP cost for repairing the item in an anvil.
* _**The Alchemist...**_
  * Located in Emberlyn, you can purchase randomized potions from the Alchemist in The Perilous Potion.
  * Benevolent potions (on the left) give positive effects while malevolent potions (on the right) give negative ones \[these are cheaper].
  * You get 4 potions (stacked!) per purchase.
  * The potions will have randomized effects, including effects not normally found in potions.
* _**Fishing...**_
  * When you fish, you have a chance to catch 1 of 26 types of fish. This includes the normal fish (cod, salmon, etc.) but also includes unique fish (stingray, jellyfish, etc.).
  * Each fish is also given a few variables: overall quality of the fish (1 to 5 stars), length (in scale 0-100) and weight (in scale 0-100). These variables together decide the price of the fish.
  * Fish can be sold to the Fishmonger in Emberlyn -- right clicking will sell your held fish, sneaking + right clicking will sell all the fish in your inventory.
  * Since these fish don't stack, inventory space will be a concern. Our recommendation is to use bundles -- they work perfectly for this system.
* Players can right click on stairs, slabs, or carpets (or run `/sit`) to sit down.
* Only one player needs to sleep for night to pass, but other players can cancel it.
* Creeper explosions do not break blocks.
* Players can right click with a shulker box in their hand to open it.
* Players can sneak + right click with a crafting table or ender chest to open it.
* Falling into the void in the End will teleport the player to the Overworld.
* Players can eat Glowberries to glow for a brief period of time.
* Froglights do different things!&#x20;
