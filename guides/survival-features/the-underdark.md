# ⛏️ The Underdark

Located in the Stronghold (near the Cells) is a portal to the _Underdark_, a custom dimension.

* The only way to leave the Underdark is back through the entrance portal.
* You cannot bring any items to the Underdark (they will be automatically dropped upon entering the portal).&#x20;
* There is no keep-inventory or item dropping in the Underdark. If you die, your inventory will be deleted.
* Mobs are faster and stronger in the Underdark, and can vary in size.
* You can mine freely and loot structures (which includes trial chambers). Please continue to respect the [Survival Standards](../../rules/survival-standards.md) when it comes to structures in the Underdark.
