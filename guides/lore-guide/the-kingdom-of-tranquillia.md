It is a collective of <mark style="background-color:yellow;">merchants</mark>, settled together to better protect each other. The location has since grown into a sprawling city in central Tranquillia. They form a large open market that never truly closes thanks to its main residents' opposing schedules.

#### Placid Caravan (Clan)

Wishing to return to the old ways of the Nation, a not insignificant group of <mark style="background-color:green;">mostly sylphs and humans</mark> decided to retread the roads of yore, and become <mark style="background-color:yellow;">nomadic</mark> like their forefathers. They make their living by setting up a market near or in a town and move on to the next when all possible deals have been made. They roam Tranquillia, although some eventually decide to leave and bring their nomadic lifestyle elsewhere.

_Characters from this location won't be used to settling down, and might have several different houses or shops scattered around the map. Alternatively, they might not have a permanent home at all._
