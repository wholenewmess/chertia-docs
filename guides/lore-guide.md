**Divian**

Divian is the world in which our story takes place. It is comprised of several different nations, all of which are relatively new.

The story takes place in the year 1624 of Divian. Years of war (including an intense magical explosion 50 years ago) have left the world in a fragile state, with new magic and technology competing. A new war seems to be on the horizon, and the players have converged on a "neutral zone" (marked in white on the map at the bottom of this page) for various different reasons. **It's up to you to create a character that fits within this world**, but we are always here to help you. Read as much as you can digest before starting your character -- it will help a lot.

If you're struggling, we recommend choosing a location/clan at random and just going with it -- it will be a fun challenge! When creating your character, you can deviate from the description of how your character "should" be, but make sure it makes sense in the context of that group.

Stars denote population.
