{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/chertia modpack version 34.zip" %}

#### 🔧  Installation

1. Download and install [<mark style="color:blue;">Fabric</mark>](https://fabricmc.net).
2. Download the modpack and unzip it.
3. (RECOMMENDED) Download the FancyMenu config below, and create a "fancymenu" folder in the config folder in your Minecraft directory. Place the files inside the downloaded ZIP into this new folder (see image below for example).
4. (RECOMMENDED) Download [Ambient Sounds](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fM515JnW/versions/fMT5SCgk/AmbientSounds\_FABRIC\_v6.0.2\_mc1.21.jar) (good for roleplay immersion).
5. In your Minecraft launcher, create a new profile. Under "Version", select the latest Fabric loader.
6. Save, and then hover over the instance in your "Installations" tab in the Launcher. Click the little folder icon.
7. Place all .jar files from the unzipped modpack into the 'mods' folder in your Minecraft installation. If a mods directory doesn't exist, create one.
8. Launch the game using the installation & enjoy!
