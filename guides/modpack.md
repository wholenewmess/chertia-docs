# 📦 Modpack

Chertia Requiem uses a custom modpack simply called _Requiem_. The modpack is purely client-side and adds a number of QOL features. We ask that you only use the mods that are provided in this modpack, unless an exception is granted by an administrator.&#x20;

### Download

To install the modpack, we highly recommend using the Modrinth launcher, which you can download [here](https://modrinth.com/app). Once installed, navigate to the explore page and search for 'Requiem' - you should see the Chertia logo as the modpack's icon.

Alternatively, the modpack file can be [downloaded from the Modrinth page here](https://modrinth.com/modpack/requiem-vanilla). Ensure you download the latest version.

If you're averse to the Modrinth launcher, it is possible to download the .mrpack file and exchange it for a ZIP file by visiting [this website](https://fabulously-optimized.github.io/mrpack-to-zip/) and providing the Modrinth ID for the modpack, which is `AlxoR1AY`. You can then install the mod files manually - however, we strongly recommend using the launcher.

For a list of mods included, click the 'Versions' tab on the Modrinth page and click the name of the latest version (for example, 1.2.0). Most mods can be disabled if you'd prefer not to have them.

### Changelog

{% hint style="warning" %}
From time to time, the modpack is updated to change out certain mods. It is not necessary for you to update, unless we are changing Minecraft versions (for example, 26.1 -> 26.2).
{% endhint %}
