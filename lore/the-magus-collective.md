### Description

_A nation of magic-wielders, founded in 1547. They mostly see technology as inferior to magic. Many blame them for the events of the Second Great Magic War, including the explosion that wiped out much of Divian._

_A Grandmaster is elected, and the role is currently filled by Mephilim Suvos of House Suvos._

### Houses

#### House Suvos

Inhabited by <mark style="background-color:green;">elves, drow, and humans</mark> in the central region of the collective. This House focuses on research into <mark style="background-color:yellow;">traditional magic</mark>. Commoners work for the nobles in physical capacity, but may be trained in magic if they have high potential. House Suvos mainly lives in Corionium, the capital of the collective. However, the city is still in partial ruins, resulting in a few commoners and nobles living on the eastern island known as Belial's Rest.

_Characters from this house will be interested in traditional magic._

#### House Alkoy

Comprised of races of the night (<mark style="background-color:green;">Unseelie, Wolffolk, Dwarves, Drow, Tieflings</mark>). This House focuses on research into <mark style="background-color:yellow;">necromancy and soul magic</mark>, and are occasionally known to <mark style="background-color:yellow;">cross unsavoury lines</mark> in their work. The commoners of House Alkoy keep to the shadows so much that they are practically unknown to even each other.

_Characters from this house will be interested in necromancy and soul magic._

#### House Salint

Comprised of <mark style="background-color:green;">sylphs and avians</mark>, this House mainly researches <mark style="background-color:yellow;">mind and dream magics</mark>. While small, House Salint is considered a very <mark style="background-color:yellow;">stable</mark> group. Commoners work in a physical capacity, but are knowledgeable on the House's expertise in mind magic for <mark style="background-color:yellow;">interrogation</mark>.

_Characters from this house will be interested in dream and mind magic._

#### House Uron

Comprised of <mark style="background-color:green;">dwarves</mark> (nobles) and <mark style="background-color:green;">golems</mark> (commoners), this House mainly researches <mark style="background-color:yellow;">enchanting and artificing</mark>. Golems from this House have been 'created' by their nobles, but have recently been revolting. This house is largely in <mark style="background-color:yellow;">disarray</mark>.

_Characters from this house will be interested in enchanting._

#### House Mevos

Comprised of <mark style="background-color:green;">various races</mark>, this House largely does not associate with the rest of the Magus Collective. They focus on <mark style="background-color:yellow;">healing magic</mark>, but wish to serve a larger group than just the Collective, despite House Suvos's insistence of otherwise.

_Characters from this house will be interested in healing magic._
