# 🗺️ The World of Divian

### The World of Divian

Divian is the world in which our story takes place. The story takes place in the year 1791 of Divian. 166 years ago, an intense magical outburst called the Chaos Event drastically changed the world's climate and magic. The people of Divian have since grown accustomed to this new climate, but in recent years, magic has once again begun to increase in prevalence.&#x20;

**It's up to you to create a character that fits within this world**, but we are always here to help you.

### Your Character

Your character has arrived in Luminara, a new nation in northern Divian. They have been drawn there by some sort of magical force — compelled to settle there. You will select a clan/origin for your character based on the provided list, but it is up to you if your character feels at-home within that clan or out-of-place.&#x20;

Believing in all forms of strength, the people of Yvera place high value in training and combat.
