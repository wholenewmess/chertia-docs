### Character Races

There are plenty of species and races in Divian. In recent years, an increase in magical activity has led to much greater variety. However, with increasing tension in the world of Divian, many races have begun to stick closer together, which has caused certain traditions and personality traits to appear within each. As the world is so diverse, freedom is given to the player to make certain assumptions or decisions about their character's physical characteristics, and character personalities may differ from the race's common behaviours.

Certain races have sub-races (often with different personality traits) and/or variations (functionally the same but have differences in appearance). **Meta explanation:** Sub-races are treated as separate races, while variations simply allow for more player interpretations of the race. If a race has sub-races, you can still select the main race (for example, you can simply be a Sylvari, you don't _need_ to select a sub-race).&#x20;

The **RP Difficulty** field is simply a suggestion. It is a measure of how difficult it will be for a player to maintain a race's typical personality traits while still performing conversational and meaningful roleplay. It is possible (and common) to create a character that is either much lower or higher in RP Difficulty based on how you design their specific personality and behaviours.

#### List of Character Races

<details>

<summary>👦 <strong>Human</strong></summary>

Humans are humans. Adaptable, ambitious, and quite common in Divian. Their shorter lifespans drive them to build legacies quickly. Their interactions with others are often seen as determined or impatient. Their ambition drives them.

* **Lifespan:** 70-100 years (child until 18)
* **Height:** 150-200cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️

</details>

<summary>🪶 <strong>Avian</strong></summary>

Avians are feathered folk with bird-like features (beaks, talons, and plumage that varies widly by lineage). Their hollow bones make them lighter and more agile, but also more fragile; they are careful to avoid conflict except from a distance. Avians can communicate emotions through their feathers: ruffling can indiciate agitation, slicked-back feathers can indicate focus or aggression, and preening towards others can indicate comfort or affection. They often avoid enclosed spaces.

* **Lifespan:** 60-90 years (child until 16)
* **Height:** 155-205cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️

#### Sub-Races

* **Owlkin:** Much more recluse and quick to aggression than typical Avians. Typically prefers to act at night, so as not to be seen by others. Increases RP Difficulty to ⭐️⭐️.

#### **Variations**

* Corvid (crows, ravens)
* Raptor (hawks, eagles)
* Songbird (smaller and lighter)

<summary>🔔 <strong>Bellfolk</strong></summary>

A much more recent addition to Divian, Bellfolk are gentle humanoids with small bells or crystalline growths naturally forming in their hair, skin, or along their limbs. Different bells on their body ring in various ways to indicate mood. Bright, quick chimes can indicate joy or excitement; slow, muted tones suggest sadness; discordant jangling can represent fear or anger. When Bellfolk are unwell, the sounds of their bells become much more muted and dull. Complimenting a Bellfolk's song is deeply flattering; mimicking or mocking them is a serious insult.

* **Lifespan:** 90-140 years (child until 16)
* **Height:** 150-180cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️

#### **Variations**

* Copper (their skin or bells may change in colour over time)

</details>

<details>

<summary>⛏️ <strong>Dwarf</strong></summary>

Dwarves are stout, sturdy folk with a deep connection to stone, metal, and craftsmanship. They have long lifespans and are often patient and considered; consequently, they are prone to holding grudges. Dwarves typically value directness when conversing with others; pleasantries and flowery language are seen as wasteful or even suspicious. Some dwarves feel threatened by taller races, and may insist on seated conversations.

* **Lifespan:** 160-180 years (child until 24)
* **Height:** 110-140cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️

#### Sub-Races

* **Burrower:** Small, comfort-loving folk who live in cozy underground homes, much closer to the surface than typical Dwarves. They are often very friendly and hospitable. However, threatening them or their loved ones will not end well; a cornered Burrower is not to be underestimated. Reduces RP Difficulty to ⭐️.
* **Capling:** Often live aboveground, using their extended lifespan to focus on larger building projects. They are somewhat grumpy but fiercely loyal.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>🧚 <strong>Fae</strong></summary>

Fae are small, winged folk with a strange sense of logic and a complicated relationship with truth. Although they don't intentionally lie, it can often seem like Fae are simply incompatible with the world of Divian, and fail to understand or fully articulate language. Deals and promises are sacred to Fae; their opinions of others are based solely on trust. This can cause complications when Fae are met with flowery or polite language (a simple "see you tomorrow" may be seen as a binding agreement to a Fae). Fae often avoid wearing heavy armour or wielding heavy weapons. _It is an incredibly complex race to play, and we recommend that new players select another race for their first character (this is just a suggestion)._

* **Lifespan:** 150-250 years (child until 30)
* **Height:** 80cm-140cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

#### Sub-Races

* **Pixie:** Much smaller than other Fae (max height of 120cm). They are mischievous creatures, and use the confusion caused by Fae dialogue to their advantage.
* **Sprite:** Nature-bound Fae who are much more serious. They are much better with language than other Fae. Reduces RP Difficulty to ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
* **Wisp:** Ethereal, quiet Fae who are much slower to trust and interact with others comfortably. They are not ghosts, but often move so quietly that they remain undetected. Reduces RP Difficulty to ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

<summary>🦁 <strong>Feline</strong></summary>

Felines are cat-like humanoids which range greatly in appearance and personality. They are known for their agility, independence, and territorial nature. A feline inviting someone into their home is seen as a sign of great respect or comfort. Somewhat hypocritically, however, felines are incredibly curious and quick to search others' belongings. Their ears and tail often betray their emotions. A Feline who ignores you may actually like you; one who's overly attentive might be sizing you up.

* **Lifespan:** 70-90 years (child until 16)
* **Height:** 140cm-190cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️

#### Variations

* Lionfolk (longer hair with a beard or mane)
* Lynx (wild, tuft ears)
* Softpaw (domestic, smaller)

</details>

<details>

<summary>🤖 <strong>Golem</strong></summary>

Golems are redstone-powered constructs - they are crafted beings, made of metal, stone, and magical engineering. In recent years, they have become more connected to Divian itself and now require typical satiation rather than pure redstone. Each golem typically has one main drive or purpose, often drawn from the circumstances around their creation. They are often seen as tools, servants, or curiosities, which can make socializing complex. They do not act on instinct.

* **Lifespan:** ???
* **Height:** 140cm-180cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

#### Variations

* Ironclad (heavy and durable)
* Ticker (small, intricate)
* Runewrought (magic-infused)
* Scrapbuilt (cobbled together)

</details>

<details>

<summary>💡 <strong>Mothkin</strong></summary>

Mothkin are soft, fuzzy folk with large eyes and feathery antannae. They are noctural by nature yet typically drawn to light sources. Their antannae are expressive: they perk up when Mothkin are interested, droop when they are sad or unwell, and vibrate when they are excited or angry. They often communicate through physical proximity: they sit close to friends or loved ones, and maintain good distance from those they do not trust. A Mothkin offering to sit or work with you in silence is a sign of trust.

* **Lifespan:** 40-70 years (child until 12)
* **Height:** 140cm-170cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️

#### Sub-Races

* **Duskmoths:** A much more reclusive and unfriendly variant of Mothkin; they have sunset-coloured wings and a darker tone. Increases RP Difficulty to ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

</details>

<details>

<summary>🌿 <strong>Sylvari</strong></summary>

Sylvari are plant-based folk. They vary greatly in appearance and biology, despite being classified under the same name. Sylvari feel a deep connection to natural cycles, and often 'bloom' or change seasonally. Their mood can be read through their foliage; they wilter when sad, brighten when happy, and can produce thorns when angry or defensive. &#x20;

* **Lifespan:** 120-200 years (child until 20)
* **Height:** 130cm-210cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️

#### Sub-Races

* **Florahyte:** Flower and vine-based. They often smell faintly of flowers. Typically much more reserved and dislike overt attention.
* **Willowkin:** Tree-based, tall and graceful with drooping hair. They are slow to act, but are deeply thoughtful and generally very kind. Reduces RP Difficulty to ⭐️⭐️.
* **Creakling:** Gnarled, bark-heavy, and ancient-looking even when young. Creaklings are sturdy, grumpy, and fiercely protective. Increases RP Difficulty to ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
* **Sporeling:** Fungal folks with mushroom-like appearances. They emit spores based on their emotion or state; more spores often mean that Sporelings are stressed or feel threatened. They thrive in darkness.

</details>

<details>

<summary>🧜‍♀️ <strong>Tidefolk</strong></summary>

Tidefolk are aquatic or semi-aquatic creatures intrinsically tied to water. Recent magical activity has empowered tidefolk to live comfortably on land, but they typically choose to live close to a body of water. Prolonged time in arid environments can make them irritable, sluggish, or even unwell. Their skin often glistens faintly. They are varied in personality, but often prefer careful, considered action and dialogue; rushing them can be considered rude.

* **Lifespan:** 100-140 years&#x20;
* **Height:** 140cm-190cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️

#### Sub-Races

* **Nymph:** Freshwater-based; often found near rivers, lakes, and springs. Nymphs are emotionally intuitive and often serve as mediators or peacekeepers. They typically have blue or green undertones to their skin.
* **Merfolk:** Ocean-based; they feature scaled patches, webbed digits, and fin-like ears. They're bold, adventurous, and quick-moving.&#x20;
* **Coralkin:** Reef-dwellers with colourful coral growths. They're patient and friendly, which is often seen as a weakness by other races. Their coral formations can indicate health or general well-being; they lose colour if they are sick or injured.

</details>

<details>

<summary>👹 <strong>Tiefling</strong></summary>

Tieflings are human-like creatures which often feature horns, tails, and unusual skin tones. Despite their appearance, they are not inherently evil, but they face a great deal of skepticism from other races. Many Tieflings will develop sharp social skills to navigate this, and are typically good at reading a room. This helps them in combat as well, as they are quick on their feet and excel at assessing danger. Their tails are expressive; they flick when irritated, curl when comfortable or content, and lash when angry. Perceptive observers can read a Tiefling's mood even when their face remains neutral.

* **Lifespan:** 100-150 years (child until 18)
* **Height:** 150cm-200cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

#### Variations

* Red (longer horns and tails)
* Purple (very short horns)
* Ashen (extremely long tails)

</details>

<details>

<summary>📜 <strong>Villager</strong></summary>

Villagers are tall, long-nosed folk with a deep-rooted culture of trade, profession, and community. Every Villager is defined by their craft, which is often given to them unwillingly. Villagers are librarians, cartographers, fletchers, butchers, and more. Some villagers will even introduce themselves by their profession before providing their name. They speak in a distinctive manner, often humming or nodding or making noncommittal sounds ("hmm", "hrrm"). Interrupting or mocking these sounds is considered very rude. Villagers sleep precisely at dusk and wake at dawn, and become distressed when this schedule is disrupted. They are terrified of zombies.

* **Lifespan:** 70-90 years (child until 16)
* **Height:** 160cm-210cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️

#### Sub-Races

* **Cleric:** Distinct from other professions, these villagers have a deep affinity for the divine and often choose to build churches or shrines. Other villagers look up to Clerics.
* **Wanderer:** These villagers typically move from home to home on a frequent basis, only settling down once they find a suitable village or partner.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>🐺 <strong>Wolffolk</strong></summary>

Lupine humanoids with fur, pointed ears, and keen senses. They're typically pack-oriented by nature, and seek to form tight-knit social bonds. Body language matters more than words to Wolffolk; direct eye contact can be seen as challenging or a sign of respect depending on the context. Lone Wolffolk are either fiercely independent or deeply wounded.

* **Lifespan:** 160-210 years (child until 15)
* **Height:** 160cm-210cm
* **RP Difficulty:** ⭐️⭐️
