### Description

_Founded in the late 1610s, Keluarga is made up of two islands -- Matahari and Bumi._

**Matahari** - the largest island. Rich soil, courtesy of the dormant volcano in island center, allows for fields of agriculture almost across the entire land. The population is very diverse, as it's the main point through which interaction with the main continent occurs. The people here are free-thinkers. Natives are educated about world history, with access and interaction to features all around the main island. Scholars are encouraged to study abroad to broaden their understanding; sailors are bright, wandering souls in search of the next discovery; soldiers are diplomats trained in unity.

**Bumi** - the smaller island. Though much smaller in landmass than Matahari, their general populations pretty much match. Made up of clans which are generally more closed-off than those on Matahari. Many scholars from Matahari choose to do their studying on Bumi.

### Groups

#### Pelabuhan (Location)

The most prominent location in Keluarga, located on Matahari. The large, <mark style="background-color:green;">inclusive</mark> port city of Pelabuhan is filled with merchants from all over Divian, who see this developing city as the perfect place for <mark style="background-color:yellow;">trade</mark>. A direct trade route with the Keepers of the Coin keeps the economy moving smoothly.&#x20;

_Characters from Pelabuhan are generally aspirational, wanting to build a personal empire of sorts -- whether that be through buildings, money, or connections._

#### The Solar Scholars (Clan)

The Solar Scholars is an <mark style="background-color:yellow;">inclusive</mark> school in southern Matahari. The Headmaster, currently Headmaster Riset, is elected and serves as the main source of curriculum for the school. Once its students complete their primary education, they are sent to complete a 'knowledge quest' somewhere in the world, with the aim of returning as a fully developed scholar.&#x20;

_Characters from the Solar Scholars are on their knowledge quest._

#### The Jalan (Clan)

The Jalan are (<mark style="background-color:yellow;">typically human</mark>) <mark style="background-color:green;">wanderers and explorers</mark> who roam Matahari and beyond in search of new discoveries. They are known for their distinctive <mark style="background-color:green;">clothing and tattoos</mark> that mark their travels and findings.&#x20;

_Characters belonging to the Jalan share a deep connection with their past, and are happy to share their stories and findings, inspiring others to embark on their own journeys._

#### Mengamati (Location)

Mengamati is a scattered village in eastern Bumi. Its <mark style="background-color:yellow;">varied</mark> residents are typically scholars who have graduated from The Solar Scholars, and now spend their days <mark style="background-color:green;">researching and observing</mark> the various mysteries of the universe. They believe in calculated <mark style="background-color:green;">observation</mark> of the world's hidden truths and often offer cryptic advice to those who seek their wisdom.&#x20;

_Characters from Mengamati are typically observant, but reluctant to share their knowledge with those they don't deem intelligent enough._
