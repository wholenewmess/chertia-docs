# ‚úíÔ∏è The World of Divian

### The World of **Divian**

Divian is the world in which our story takes place.  The story takes place in the year 1729 of Divian. 104 years ago, an intenense magical outburst called the Chaos Event drastically changed the world's climate and magic. The people of Divian are still adjusting to this new world, and your character is one of them. While they're aware of the Chaos Event, they may not fully understand its implications or causes, depending on their upbringing and backstory.&#x20;

**It's up to you to create a character that fits within this world**, but we are always here to help you.&#x20;

### Your Character

Your character has arrived in the new nation of Solaria, seeking either power or belonging. It's up to you if your character felt out-of-place in their original clan, or they simply seek something more. The personality and details of your character are up to you, but their origin must be selected from the list below.

### List of Clans

Each character originates from a particular clan in Divian. Here is a list of clans and details about them.
