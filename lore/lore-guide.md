**Divian**

Divian is the world in which our story takes place. It is comprised of several different nations, all of which are relatively new.

The story takes place in the year 1729 of Divian. 104 years ago, an intenense magical outburst called the Chaos Event drastically changed the world's climate and magic. The people of Divian are still adjusting to this new world, and your character is one of them. **It's up to you to create a character that fits within this world**, but we are always here to help you. Read as much as you can digest before starting your character -- it will help a lot.

If you're struggling, we recommend choosing a location/clan at random and just going with it -- it will be a fun challenge! When creating your character, you can deviate from the description of how your character "should" be, but make sure it makes sense in the context of that group.
