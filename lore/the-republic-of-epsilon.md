### Groups

#### Cevilla (Clan)

This <mark style="background-color:green;">diverse</mark> clan is a coalition of <mark style="background-color:yellow;">adventuring</mark> groups. Considered to be loosely named after the old Goddess of Adventure, the Cevilla clan are <mark style="background-color:yellow;">expansionists</mark>. They believe in discovering new places and making it theirs -- to the point where they can sometimes be viewed as thieves.

_Characters from this region will seek possessions and territory._

#### The Bronze Shield (Location)

This is a <mark style="background-color:green;">diverse</mark> city in the eastern region of the unmarked territory, currently owned by Theta. The city is divided into <mark style="background-color:yellow;">warriors and traders</mark>. Warriors train to protect the clan, while traders run the economy and perform research. The structure is not concrete, and the clan is very open. They are known, however, for occasionally being <mark style="background-color:yellow;">reckless</mark>.

_Characters from this region will be opinionated and focused on combat or trade._

#### Bluefire (Location/Clan)

Bluefire is a city in the southern region of the unmarked territory, and also the name of the clan that inhabits it. It is primarily comprised of <mark style="background-color:green;">humans, golems, and elves</mark>, but others are welcome. It is Epsilon's most populous clan, and mainly focuses on <mark style="background-color:yellow;">technological research</mark>. It is the home of Leader Tendaji Madaki.

_Characters from this region will have an affinity for technology._
