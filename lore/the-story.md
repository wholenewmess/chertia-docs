# üìú The Story

### üó∫Ô∏è Divian / The World

For information on Divian -- the world in which the story takes place -- visit [The World of Divian](lore-guide.md) guide.

### üìú The Story So Far

Divian‚Äôs history is filled with **gods**, monsters, magic, and heroes. Beings of nigh immortality and incredible power, the Gods have emerged, ruled, fought, and died across the years of their existence. After the Chaos Event, however, much of their history and existence has faded into myths and legends. Few places in the world remember their role in history - and fewer still see them in a good light.

Known to these few places as the 24 ‚ÄúGods of Old‚Äù (or 26, depending on who one asks), they were established as possessing particular kinds of power and magic. Now, after the Chaos Event, two new Gods have emerged in Divian, possessing powers far different from those in the past. The gods maintain their power by protecting their **catalysts** (their sources of power), sought after by Catalyst Hunters and regular power-hungry mortals from across Divian.

Since the Chaos Event, the magic of Divian has shifted dramatically in its functionality and appearance. Previously learned and created spells now appear as strange runes, which can be attached to items. How this occurs remains unknown, but a group of people from across Divian, calling themselves Runeseekers, dedicate themselves to searching for these runes and understanding them.

<summary>Part 1: "Runes of Power"</summary>

Adventurers from all across Divian made their way to the town of Emberlyn in Solaria, where they met Yasumi, their mentor Esher, the runeseeker Aeliana, and sibling adventurers Brenn and Meilin. Strange happenings occurred in Solaria, leading to the emergence of two new gods: Kaijin, the God of Strength; and Linumi, the Goddess of Commune.

<summary>Part 2: "Kaijin &#x26; Linumi"</summary>

At first, the two gods were on their own, but were brought together by Yasumi to meet each other. Unfortunately, the meeting led to a fight between the two and a war was declared. The adventurers attempted to stop this conflict by playing both sides, when a mysterious Catalyst Seeker used a strange power to take over the body of Linumi!

While the adventurers managed to subdue the possessed god, and Kaijin prevented Linumi from destroying herself - ending the war between them - the gods have isolated themselves once again, leaving the adventurers troubled over these recent events.

<summary>Part 3: "On the Run"</summary>

After the adventurers endure a series of strange events, Linumi returns to Solaria with knowledge of the old gods and how they embodied their titles. When the adventurers host the Festival of Bonds, the sense of community gives Linumi power, bringing her closer to ‚ÄúDivine Enlightenment‚Äù.

Kaijin attempts this himself, but fails. Linumi and the adventurers claim that Kaijin‚Äôs interpretation of his title may be wrong, but Kaijin refuses to believe it and leaves to go and train.
