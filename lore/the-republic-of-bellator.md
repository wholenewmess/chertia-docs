### Description

_Founded in 1559, they mainly formed as an opposition to the tyrannical Magus Collective. After the results of the Second Great Magic War, they are typically against all forms of magic, and seek to maintain peace and order._

_Each major clan/location has one vote at the table when it comes to decisions in this nation._

### Groups

#### The Flame Crest (Clan)

A <mark style="background-color:green;">**tiefling-dominated**</mark> clan that lives in southeastern Bellator. Their leader, who maintains a mystery identity, makes all of the important decisions. Despite the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">authoritarian</mark> setup, Flame Crest is a successful clan, spanning several towns and locations in Bellator. They are comprised of many viewpoints and ideologies, but share a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">suspicion</mark> for groups from Matrona.&#x20;

_Characters from this clan are used to being told what to do, but can have a variety of viewpoints and ideologies._

#### Yvera (Location)

Yvera is Bellator's most populous and <mark style="background-color:green;">**diverse**</mark> city. Its democratically-elected leader is Illia Castorius, and they operate with a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">communal</mark> focus. They believe that <mark style="background-color:yellow;">strength</mark> is the most important element of survival, and typically lead a harsh lifestyle with their children being trained for <mark style="background-color:yellow;">combat</mark> from an early age. Many believe this town's development was a direct response to the events of the Second Great Magic War.

_Characters from this location will be well-versed in combat._

#### The Magic Hunters (Clan)

This <mark style="background-color:green;">**human-only**</mark> clan in southern Bellator is <mark style="background-color:yellow;">vehemently against all forms of magic</mark>, and go as far as seeking out and killing any "wielders" they can find. Their influence has led to Bellator being a relatively magic-free nation as a whole. This clan trains their young to become <mark style="background-color:yellow;">skilled hunters</mark>. The eldest member of this clan typically serves as the de-facto leader.

_Characters from this clan will typically despise all magic wielders, and will be skilled hunters._

#### Obsidian Blades (Clan)

This relatively-new clan is comprised mostly of <mark style="background-color:green;">**humans and wolffolk**</mark>. Many of them are former mercenaries from other clans in Bellator, and have largely <mark style="background-color:yellow;">isolated</mark> themselves in the mountains of the southwest.

_Characters from this clan may be lacking in social skills, but are generally kind-hearted._
