### Description

_Founded in 1607, this is a matriarchal nation that values diversity and knowledge. The nation was founded on exclusivity to Nymphs and Dryads, but has since expanded to include all races._&#x20;

_Snowmage are the primary leaders of Matrona, and typically make the decisions._

### Groups

#### Alchemilla (Clan)

Located in southern Matrona, this <mark style="background-color:green;">nymph and dryad-dominated</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">environmentalist</mark> clan is highly influential. Their leader is Euridice Cliforia. They are one of the founding clans of The Matrona State, and lead a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">druidic</mark> lifestyle. They are suspicious of the other clans' inclusion of races other than Nymphs and Dryads. They believe in <mark style="background-color:yellow;">shared success</mark>, but only among those they consider acceptable.

_Characters from this clan will have a focus on shared success, but may be suspicious of others._

#### Lanturna Valley (Location)

In the east of Matrona lies Lanturna, a valley with a large river running through it. On one side of Lanturna is a small group of <mark style="background-color:green;">nymphs</mark> who have lived in this region for a long time. They have various viewpoints and, while they typically have followed the stereotypical Matrona suspicion of other races, have recently befriended a group of <mark style="background-color:green;">golems</mark> living on the other side of the valley. The golems were brought to Lanturna by the Nymphs, who have tried to <mark style="background-color:yellow;">protect</mark> them from the problems they would have faced in the rest of the nation.

Lanturna now heavily relies on the golems' work underground, caving and mining, to maintain <mark style="background-color:yellow;">sustainability</mark>.

_Characters from this location will either be generous nymphs or work-focused golems._

### Former Settlements & Clans

_Note: your character cannot originate from these locations._

#### Snowmage (Location)

A city in the far north of Matrona, comprised of <mark style="background-color:green;">various races</mark> and cultures. Snowmage is headed by Madam Meriline, who was democratically elected. Many citizens of Snowmage are <mark style="background-color:yellow;">skeptical of magic</mark>, as they believe it is very dangerous. Snowmage has a large focus on <mark style="background-color:yellow;">education</mark> and the sharing of knowledge. They believe that only well-read and intelligent people can truly contribute to society, but they do their best to ensure everyone is included in that description.

Snowmage was destroyed by Kyalite in August 1624.
