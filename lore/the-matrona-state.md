### Description

_Founded in 1607, this is a matriarchal nation that values diversity and knowledge. The nation was founded on exclusivity to Nymphs and Dryads, but has since expanded to include all races._&#x20;

_Snowmage are the primary leaders of Matrona, and typically make the decisions._

### Groups

#### Alchemilla (Clan)

Located in southern Matrona, this <mark style="background-color:green;">**nymph and dryad-dominated**</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">environmentalist</mark> clan is highly influential. Their leader is Euridice Cliforia. They are one of the founding clans of The Matrona State, and lead a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">druidic</mark> lifestyle. They are suspicious of the other clans' inclusion of races other than Nymphs and Dryads. They believe in <mark style="background-color:yellow;">shared success</mark>, but only among those they consider acceptable.

_Characters from this clan will have a focus on shared success, but may be suspicious of others._

#### Snowmage (Location)

A city in the far north of Matrona, comprised of <mark style="background-color:green;">**various races**</mark> and cultures. Snowmage is headed by Madam Meriline, who was democratically elected. Many citizens of Snowmage are <mark style="background-color:yellow;">skeptical of magic</mark>, as they believe it is very dangerous. Snowmage has a large focus on <mark style="background-color:yellow;">education</mark> and the sharing of knowledge. They believe that only well-read and intelligent people can truly contribute to society, but they do their best to ensure everyone is included in that description.

Snowmage are currently facing the threat of magic's resurgence in the region, as many of the higher-ups (hypocritcally) do not want children being taught about magic.

_Characters from this location will be eager to learn and gain more knowledge, but may be skeptical of magic._

#### Lanturna Valley (Location)

In the east of Matrona lies Lanturna, a valley with a large river running through it. On one side of Lanturna is a small group of <mark style="background-color:green;">**nymphs**</mark> who have lived in this region for a long time. They have various viewpoints and, while they typically have followed the stereotypical Matrona suspicion of other races, have recently befriended a group of <mark style="background-color:green;">**golems**</mark> living on the other side of the valley. The golems were brought to Lanturna by the Nymphs, who have tried to <mark style="background-color:yellow;">protect</mark> them from the problems they would have faced in the rest of the nation.

Lanturna now heavily relies on the golems' work underground, caving and mining, to maintain <mark style="background-color:yellow;">sustainability</mark>.

_Characters from this location will either be generous nymphs or work-focused golems._
