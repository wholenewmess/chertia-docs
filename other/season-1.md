## Part 1: "Welcome to Chertia"

### Chapter 1: "Welcome to Chertia"

_January 10, 2020_

The players arrive in the Bluebell province, disoriented and unsure of their surroundings. As they explore the area and gather resources, they meet Chertia, a woman who reveals herself as the Goddess of Kindness. She is curious about how the players arrived, having detected a magical signal leading her to them. The players, however, are unable to explain their sudden appearance. During their conversation, a man named Syenite appears, introducing himself as the God of Chaos and Chertia's brother. Tension arises as Chertia asks Syenite to leave, but he refuses and engages with the players.

The situation becomes more complex when Mylonite, the Goddess of Balance, arrives. Chertia explains to Mylonite that the players' teleportation to the province triggered the magic signal she detected. Syenite, suspicious of the players, contemplates imprisoning them but eventually agrees to let them stay as long as they avoid certain areas. Chertia reveals that the Bluebell Province is home to their most valuable possessions, including their Cores, which contain their magic and soul. She explains that while mortals can touch the God Cores, they cannot take or use them. Syenite, bored, leaves after dismissing the players, and Chertia hints at a growing conflict between her and Syenite over the kingdom's future.

Chertia and Mylonite discuss the brewing conflict, with Chertia advocating for development through mutual respect, while Syenite seeks to prioritize magic. Despite the tension, Chertia suggests that the players could assist with a project in the province by gathering materials for construction. After Chertia leaves, Mylonite stays behind to continue interacting with the players as they collect resources and build settlements. Syenite later returns alone, revealing more about the gods' troubled upbringing and sharing his views on devotion and the kingdom's future. He hints at a plan to restore the kingdom's glory through its magical energy, while criticizing Chertia for being overly kind and misguided in her rule.

Syenite's conversation with the players deepens the understanding of the conflict between the gods. He explains that Chertia, as the eldest, holds the "dominant core" and can control the kingdom's magical energy. Although Syenite does not intend to start a war, he does not rule out the possibility if their disagreements escalate. He emphasizes that any power struggle between the gods would not involve mortals directly. After sharing his thoughts on the nature of cores and their resilience, Syenite leaves the players to continue their activities in the province.

### Chapter 2: "Path of Devotion"

_January 15, 2020_

Syenite claims the province for himself. Chertia, angered by his audacity, attacks him with a lightning spell and traps him in a blue barrier. She declares her intention to lock him away, tired of his interference, despite Mylonite's concerns that this course of action may not be right. Chertia proposes that, while she should maintain control over the kingdom, she could give Syenite a small portion of land. However, Syenite demands equal control, which Chertia dismisses as unreasonable.

As the confrontation escalates, Syenite breaks free from Chertia's barrier using a sword and his own magic. He traps Chertia in a red barrier, turning her magic against her. Mylonite protests, but Syenite, like Chertia, ignores her. Chertia eventually breaks free, but Syenite reveals that his plan has succeeded, having combined their magics. Chertia, realizing that this means war, warns that the conflict will not end well for either of them before departing. Syenite also leaves, warning the players not to interfere, though he won't hesitate to fight them if necessary. Mylonite remains behind, discussing the situation with the players and expressing her hopes for a swift resolution, though she has a bad feeling about the impending war.

Afterward, Mylonite takes the players to a shrine near her core, where she teaches them about devotion. Kira offers to devote herself to Mylonite, initially sacrificing a prized tool and then proposing to make Mylonite the god of her kingdom, Kirtia. Mylonite accepts, completing the devotion ritual. Another player, Angel, also devotes himself to Mylonite, offering an enchanted trident. Mylonite explains the benefits and obligations of devotion, including the soul-bound divine item that remains with a devotee after death. She then advises the players to prepare for the potential war, emphasizing the need for proper armor and weapons, before leaving them to ready themselves for the uncertain times ahead.

### Chapter 3: "In Motion"

_January 17, 2020_

Mylonite and Syenite arrive, arguing over the escalating war, with Mylonite urging Syenite to ease off, but he refuses. Instead, Syenite shifts the conversation to his need to visit The End, a pocket dimension, and invites the players to accompany him. They activate a nearby portal and enter The End, where they quickly defeat a large dragon before moving on to the outer islands. Syenite collects four bottles of dragon's breath and, after thanking the players for their assistance, departs.

### Chapter 4: "Chertia & Syenite"

_January 24, 2020_

In a tense exchange, the gods Chertia and Syenite continue their conflict, with Mylonite caught in the middle. Syenite reveals that he has secretly deactivated Chertia's core, effectively removing her from power. Mylonite, while hesitant, supports this drastic action, believing it necessary to restore balance. The players, confused and concerned, question Mylonite's decision to side with Syenite, especially given the history of their past conflicts that ended disastrously when power was equally divided among gods.

Despite Chertia‚Äôs warnings about repeating past mistakes, Mylonite and Syenite remain firm in their decision, leaving the players uneasy about the future. Syenite plans to hide Chertia's core, with Mylonite insisting on knowing its location to ensure balance. The players, particularly Ace, express their doubts and concerns about the situation, but ultimately, Syenite dismisses their input, asserting control over the events. As the session concludes, Mylonite agrees to keep an eye on the situation, hinting at future plans to restore balance and resolve the brewing conflict.

### Chapter 5: "Illusions of Power"

_January 31, 2020_

Syenite's dismissive attitude toward the problems at hand, such as the resistance forming against his rule and the unresolved tension with Chertia, raises suspicions among the players.

The situation escalates when Mylonite arrives, questioning Syenite's decisions and expressing concern over his disregard for the brewing conflict. Mylonite shifts the group to a trial where the players, now jurors, must decide Syenite‚Äôs fate regarding the custody of Chertia‚Äôs core. Despite his attempts to manipulate the situation, including dismissing his lawyer and planting evidence on a player, the jury finds Syenite guilty. Mylonite demands the core, but Syenite refuses to relinquish it, leading to a heated exchange and a final act of defiance as he sets part of the town on fire before abruptly leaving.

In the aftermath, Mylonite, concerned about her brother's deteriorating mental state, reveals to the players that Syenite is likely being corrupted by Chertia's core. She proposes a risky plan to push Syenite to the brink, hoping that by angering him further, he will recognize his own corruption and lose control over his magic. Mylonite enlists the players' help in this endeavor, appealing to even Syenite's followers by urging them to see that their god is no longer in control of his actions.

### Chapter 6: "The War"

_February 7, 2020_

Syenite arrives, greeted with mixed reactions from the players. Though some express loyalty, others are skeptical and even confrontational, noting a further change in his appearance and demeanor. Syenite begins by updating the players on his efforts to stabilize magic within the realm, introducing the concept of ‚Äúdivine enchantments.‚Äù However, he quickly reveals his true intentions, expressing a desire to burn down the town, which sparks concern and tension among the players. Despite attempts to engage him in dialogue, Syenite‚Äôs unstable nature becomes increasingly apparent, leading to a chaotic atmosphere where the players prepare for a potential confrontation.

The players mock Syenite's reliance on these cores, attempting to provoke him into a mistake. This strategy is risky, but they persist, hoping to weaken Syenite‚Äôs resolve. The appearance of Mylonite adds a new dynamic, as she deactivates Syenite‚Äôs core, leaving him dependent on the unstable power of Chertia‚Äôs core. This further destabilizes Syenite, but he remains defiant, warning the players that the outcome will not be favorable for them.

The session concludes with Syenite‚Äôs ominous departure, leaving the players and Mylonite to contemplate their next move. The looming threat of a corrupted and increasingly unstable god forces the players to consider the gravity of their situation. Mylonite‚Äôs intervention has temporarily weakened Syenite, but the uncertainty of Chertia‚Äôs fate and the unpredictable nature of Syenite‚Äôs actions leave everyone on edge, knowing that a more dangerous confrontation is inevitable.

## Part 2: "The Shadows"

### Chapter 7: "Home"

_February 14, 2020_

Chertia returns, announcing that she has just come back from The Place Between Worlds. Her arrival is met with greetings and curiosity from other players. As more members join, there is a growing sense of anticipation about what Chertia experienced during her absence. The mood is light, with friendly banter and the exchange of pleasantries.

However, the tone shifts when Mylonite is summoned by the group. Upon her arrival, she begins to share troubling news. The gods had encountered a mysterious force in The Place Between Worlds, which they refer to as "The Shadow." This force seems to have the ability to counter their magic, creating a sense of unease among the players. The discussion reveals that two other gods, Variscite and Scoria, are missing, and their cores have been shattered, leading to the possibility that they might be dead.

The players express concern over the potential threat posed by The Shadow, wondering if it could have followed the deities back to their world. Despite these fears, the deities try to reassure them, explaining that they do not sense any immediate danger. Mylonite mentions that they plan to establish a means of communication between the deities and the players, allowing for better interaction and guidance in the future.

As the gods prepare to depart, the players offer sacrifices and ask questions, trying to make sense of the situation. The conversation ends on a solemn note, with the players left to ponder the implications of the events that have unfolded.

### Chapter 8: "Monster Hunters"

_February 19, 2020_

Mylonite joins the server, greeted warmly by the players who are engaged in casual banter. The mood is light as they exchange greetings, but it shifts when Chertia arrives, mentioning that Syenite will be late. Mylonite then reveals that she and Chertia need the players‚Äô help to address the growing threat of shadow monsters. The gods explain they‚Äôve spent days planning and have decided that the players will need to capture one of the shadow creatures for study. This revelation causes some anxiety among the players, who joke about sacrifices and volunteer themselves in jest. Mylonite explains that the shadow creatures seem to be targeting the players, raising the tension.

The players prepare by gathering weapons and items, following the gods to the designated area. Chertia and Mylonite set up the capture, while the players express their doubts and fears. When they finally succeed in capturing a shadow monster, the situation quickly escalates as the creature begins to resist containment.

Chaos breaks out as the shadow monster breaks free, resulting in several player deaths. The gods manage to regain control, but the incident leaves everyone shaken. Mylonite theorizes that the shadow creatures might be learning from those attempting to control them, adding an ominous layer to the situation.

Syenite, who arrives late, suggests a new strategy: collecting shadow shards to create a protective spell. The players agree to help gather the materials, feeling a mix of relief and lingering unease. The session ends with the players preparing to depart, uncertain of what new dangers they might face.

Afterward, one of the players lingers by the lake, sharing a quiet moment with Lord Syenite. They have a personal conversation, with the player expressing gratitude for the company. The gods, usually distant, show a rare moment of connection with the players. As the sun rises, Syenite takes his leave, leaving the player to reflect on the encounter and the uncertain future.

### Chapter 9: "The Shadows"

_February 21, 2020_

The mood is playful, with players teasing each other about armor and flower choices, and some deaths occur from various in-game hazards. Tensions rise when Mylonite explains the necessity of having mortals present for the spell, hinting at potential danger. Syenite, joining later, adds to the group's nervousness by pointing out the chaotic nature of the situation.

As the group prepares for the spell, they joke about their readiness and the seriousness of the situation, balancing the tension with humor. When the spell begins, it quickly turns chaotic as shadow monsters attack, leading to several player deaths. Despite the chaos, the group manages to hold on, but the spell ultimately fails, opening the gateway further for more powerful monsters to enter their realm.

In the aftermath, the group discusses the implications of the failed spell, with Mylonite and the players expressing concern over the potential for stronger monsters to appear. The session ends on an ominous note as the players prepare to face the unknown challenges ahead. Meanwhile, a new character, Oliver, arrives, revealing that he has come from another world on a mission to find Lady Scoria, adding another layer of mystery to the unfolding events. Mylonite takes Oliver aside for a private conversation, leaving the players with a mix of curiosity and unease.

### Chapter 10: "Oliver"

_February 26, 2020_

Chertia and the players discuss the gods Scoria and Syenite, revealing tensions from past betrayals. Syenite joins the conversation, causing a stir as the group discusses past events, including the attempted takeover by Scoria and Variscite.

Syenite is particularly hostile, especially when discussing Scoria, whom he refuses to forgive for past transgressions. The group prepares to meet Oliver, a mortal associated with Scoria, who appears distressed by her disappearance and the shadowy forces that may have taken her. Oliver shares his personal connection with Scoria, revealing his desire to find and possibly redeem her. His story elicits mixed reactions from the group, with some showing empathy while others remain skeptical.

As the group prepares for an impending magical ritual, they are tasked with finding three magical crystals scattered across the land. The crystals, essential for the spell, must be retrieved by the mortals. The players split up to locate them, dealing with the challenges and uncertainties that arise during their search. Tensions escalate between Syenite and Lady Chertia, culminating in Syenite's angry departure after a confrontation with Ground.

The players regroup after finding the crystals, discussing the complex history and relationships among the gods, including the revelation of their parentage and the civil war that once divided them. Lady Chertia expresses concern about the calm before the storm, hinting at greater dangers to come. The session concludes with Lady Chertia departing to speak with Oliver, leaving the group to reflect on the challenges ahead and the unresolved conflicts within their ranks.

### Chapter 11: "When Worlds Collide"

_February 28, 2020_

The session starts with Lady Chertia joining the server, warmly greeted by the players, who are preparing for an upcoming battle against shadow forces. Tensions rise as the group discusses the spell they need to perform, with Lady Mylonite confirming a 95% success rate. Despite their cautious optimism, the ritual quickly descends into chaos, with many players falling to shadow monsters.

As the ritual fails, the group debates Plan B‚Äîa drastic measure to cut off their world from others to contain the shadows. The players are unsettled by the idea of permanent isolation, but the threat of the shadows looms large. The tension escalates when Lady Scoria appears, unsettling the group with her presence. The session ends with a battle against Scoria, who is revealed to be under the influence of the shadows. The gods, now missing, leave the group to face an uncertain future, with the shadow threat still looming and the fate of their world hanging in the balance.

Syenite and Mylonite arrive, with Mylonite revealing the absence of Scoria. The group faces a sudden attack by Shadow Monsters, leading to chaos and multiple casualties.

Amidst the battle, Mylonite reveals that they managed to close the rift, but the victory feels hollow as the threat of the Shadows persists. Scoria is implicated as the source of the Shadows, causing a divide among the group on how to handle the situation. The group decides to try and separate Scoria from the Shadows, though the process is fraught with danger, nearly costing the group dearly.

As the dust settles, it becomes apparent that while Scoria is saved, the group remains trapped in their current realm, with no clear way to return to their own worlds. The session concludes with lingering doubts and unresolved tensions as the group grapples with the implications of their actions, leaving them with more questions than answers.
