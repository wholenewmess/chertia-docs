# ðŸ“” Roleplay Standards

### **ðŸ›‘ Restrictions**

In order to make everyone comfortable in the community, the following restrictions are placed on all roleplay.

1. Characters cannot engage in inappropriate activities, including sexual activities, drug use/abuse, alcohol abuse, and self-harm.
2. Graphic roleplay (torture, maiming, sexual descriptions) is strictly forbidden.
3. Engagement in romantic relationships requires the consent of both the player and the character. Characters must be canonical adults. Character romantic relationships should be kept separate from player romantic relationships.
4. Characters must speak primarily in English. Portions of speech not in English must be translated, and roleplay done in different languages must be agreed upon by all involved parties.

### **ðŸ˜Š Open-Ended Roleplay**

Your roleplay should always be open-ended. By this, we mean that your character's actions and dialogue should provide opportunities for the other character(s) to respond.

* When performing an action on another character, remove the end result from the action. The other character should have a chance to accept or reject the action.
  * **BAD:** Joe hugs Susie.
  * **GOOD:** Joe reaches his arms out to Susie for a hug.
* When expressing your character's emotions, SHOW instead of TELL. This allows the other character a chance to react to your character's emotions.
  * **BAD:** Joe is very angry at Susie.
  * **BAD:** Joe is sad.
  * **GOOD:** Joe clenches his fists as he looks at Susie.
  * **GOOD:** Joe feels tears begin to well in his eyes.
* You should not make your character the primary protagonist or antagonist of the situation (especially during events).
  * Your character can and will have moments that are about them, but you shouldn't be trying to make your character the centre of attention.
  * Your character should not be acting in an amoral (or 'evil') manner. Characters can be rude or aggressive, but should still be able to grow and develop.
* It's important not to impede existing roleplay (especially during events). Your character may be new or unfamiliar with a situation, but asking "what's going on?" or "who is that?" out loud is a distraction. Instead, try having your character pull another aside and ask for information one-on-one.

### **ðŸ“† Server Events**

During server events (roleplay events, story events, etc.) there are a few additional standards in place.&#x20;

1. If you are online during a story event, you must attend.
2. During story events, unless otherwise instructed, stick with the group.
3. During story events, do not attempt to derail the event (for example, stealing important items).
4. During story events, communicate with the group. If you have found something or have an idea, tell others.

### **ðŸ“– Additional Standards**

1. Roleplay can only be conducted on the server.
2. Blatant plagiarism from sources outside of Chertia is forbidden and will be removed from canon.
3. Take roleplay seriously, unless otherwise agreed upon between all players involved.
4. Roleplay must be set in the context of the server's lore and setting. Knowledge of real-world artifacts, mythology, religion, etc. is not canon.
5. Roleplay must use proper language structure and punctuation. Avoid using emoticons.
