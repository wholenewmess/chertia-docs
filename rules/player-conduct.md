# üìì Player Conduct

#### **Reporting Tool**

Chertia has a reporting tool for instances where you believe someone has violated the rules or safety practices. You can view & use the reporting tool [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefkaaKC4Pvw36TIHL\_xLyPPMQheF-gjwu64qfhMaOCUQ8Uyw/viewform?usp=sf\_link).

#### **Disclaimer**

When it comes to interaction in a community, there may be very different ideas of how it ‚Äòshould‚Äô be conducted. Some players prefer to interact in different ways, and this document is intended to provide a bottom line for the kinds of practices that are acceptable or unacceptable. Additionally, it contains some recommendations on interacting that will ideally keep community members safe and comfortable.&#x20;

That being said, we strongly recommend refraining from sharing _**any**_ personal information unless you are fully comfortable with those you are interacting with. Additionally, we are careful to remind you that all in-server activity is visible to online and offline staff members, which is one of the reasons why new staff members are appointed via a vote of confidence.

#### **Safety Practices**

In general, you should follow these practices at all times anywhere online.&#x20;

1. Never share private/personal information that could be used against you. It is not up to us if you want to share your given name or general location, but _**never**_ share your surname, exact location or address.&#x20;
2. Where possible, try not to reveal your age. This is another piece of information that can be used against you. Your age is included in the whitelist application as a way of staff members verifying that you are eligible to play on the server, but it is not shared with others.
3. Do not post images of yourself. Images that you post on the internet are there forever, and Discord itself has a history of ‚Äòforgetting‚Äô to delete cached images - even if you post a message and delete it afterwards, the image that the message contained might stick around for longer than you want it to. Additionally, these kinds of images can be used against you in malicious ways.
4. Do not share deep personal issues in a public forum without being aware of the consequences that may be associated with it. The staff team is always standing by, but there may be circumstances where information can be shared between community members behind our backs.
5. Do not share or joke about sexual preferences in-depth. While you may be comfortable with your sexuality and those involved in the interaction could also be, you always run the risk of a potentially malicious person either using this information against you or picking up on it as an indication of interest.&#x20;

_**In general, assume that any information you share is now public information. Consider this when you decide what you should and should not post.**_

#### **Potential Issues**

These are some of the warning signs that you should look out for when you are interacting with others in the community and elsewhere online.

1. **Player/character distinctions** are important to be aware of when interacting and roleplaying with others. The actions and thoughts of a character are not representative of the person who is playing that character. This also applies to in-character relationships, which should be separated from out-of-character interactions and relationships.
2. **Peer pressure** is a significant issue no matter what the ages of involved community members are. If you feel as though you are being peer pressured to do something that you are uncomfortable with, you should end the interaction and inform a staff member. There are several ways that someone can try to use peer pressure against you.
   1. **Appeal to empathy**; when someone takes advantage of a person‚Äôs empathy to try and get what they want, this is a form of peer pressure, and an especially dangerous one at that. For example, saying something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been feeling really bad lately, but if you did \[x] I might feel a bit better‚Äù.
   2. **Lack of boundaries**; someone may overstep their boundary with another person by attempting to make them feel ‚Äòless-than‚Äô for not doing what they want you to do. For example, ‚Äúoh, come on. It‚Äôs me you‚Äôre talking to and it‚Äôs just \[x]‚Äù.
   3. **Creating precedent**; someone might bring up the past actions of the person they are interacting with as a way of trying to get them to do something now. For example, ‚Äúbut you did \[x] last time. Why not now?‚Äù
   4. **Using threatening language;** this is the most obvious form of peer pressure, but it is dangerous nonetheless. When someone uses implications or open threats to try and get another person to do something. For example; ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do \[x] I will \[y].‚Äù&#x20;
3. **Inappropriate comments and messages** can often be difficult to pinpoint because context matters a lot. However, sexually suggestive messages that make you uncomfortable are never okay and should be reported to a staff member immediately, including the context of the message. This applies to both out-of-character and in-character interactions, on and off the server.

_**You can make it more difficult for someone to apply peer pressure on you by following the ‚Äòsafety practices‚Äô section of this document.**_

#### **Unacceptable Behaviours**

1. **Toxicity**; in situations where community members are creating or contributing to a toxic environment, the staff team may speak to those community members or take action to stop the toxicity, even if that action is not specifically mentioned in the rules. We define toxicity as creating a negative environment, causing issues in the community, being disrespectful of fellow players or staff members, being rude or inappropriate, or any version of these.&#x20;
2. **Over-indulging**; if someone is making another person feel uncomfortable with the amount of information they are sharing, whether it is because the other person does not feel comfortable having that information or the information is a trigger, the interaction should end there. If necessary, it should be reported to a staff member.
3. **Gossip**; we all have bad days, and it is perfectly acceptable for community members to feel upset at others. However, spreading gossip about community members for any reason, especially because of a personal issue, is never acceptable.&#x20;
4. **Starting and/or spreading rumours**; while this ties into the above, it is even more dangerous because the information that is being spread is false. It can affect the way that community members view each other, and eventually can severely damage the community‚Äôs ties and relationships.&#x20;
5. **Steamrolling conversation**; if someone actively ignores another person or uses a public forum as a way of venting/ranting, it can be discouraging to the other person who wants to contribute. In general, you should always try to actively listen at least half as much as you are participating. This especially applies when interacting in voice chats, where some people might feel significantly discouraged from participating if they are interrupted repeatedly or ignored altogether.
6. **Inciting conflict**; creating or pursuing issues between community members contributes to a toxic environment, especially when it happens in a public forum or separate chat. Community members should always attempt to resolve issues through DMs, and bring the issues forward to staff members if they are unable to resolve it themselves.&#x20;

#### **Mental Health**

* In extreme situations where the staff team collectively believes that a player's presence in the server is affecting their mental health or the mental health of other community members, we reserve the right to act in accordance with what we believe is best for the community as a whole as well as the individuals involved in the situation.&#x20;
* These actions are taken very seriously and are discussed at length. They are for the good of the players involved.

#### **Safety Entitlement**

* Members of the community are entitled to a standard of safety enforced by the staff team.&#x20;
* If a community member or staff member poses a threat to other community members, they will be removed from the community.&#x20;

#### **Forms of Cyberbullying**

As pulled from [<mark style="color:blue;">https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/cyberbullying-tactics</mark>](https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/cyberbullying-tactics), there are several different forms of cyberbullying that can take place, and some are more subtle than you may think. These are included, but not limited to:

1. Nude photo sharing; when inappropriate photos are shared in an interaction
2. Lies and false accusations; when rumours are started or spread
3. Bullied for being economically challenged; when someone is called ‚Äòpoor‚Äô or is bullied for a lack of a gaming-dedicated setup
4. False identity profile; creating a fake profile for someone
5. Encouraging self-harm or suicide; joking about or seriously encouraging self-harm or suicide
6. Bullied because of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, etc.; self-explanatory
7. Jealousy; bullying because someone is jealous of another person
8. Doxxing; sharing private information about someone without their permission
