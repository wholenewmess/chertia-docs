{% hint style="info" %}
**Reporting Tool:** Chertia has a reporting tool for instances where you believe someone has violated the rules or standards. You can view & use the reporting tool [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefkaaKC4Pvw36TIHL_xLyPPMQheF-gjwu64qfhMaOCUQ8Uyw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### Disclaimer

By being a part of Chertia, you agree to follow these standards. Frequent or serious infringement of these standards can result in removal from the community.&#x20;

### General Conduct

When it comes to interaction in a community, there may be very different ideas of how it ‘should’ be conducted. Some players prefer to interact in different ways, and this document is intended to provide a bottom line for the kinds of practices that are acceptable or unacceptable. Additionally, it contains some recommendations on interacting that will ideally keep community members safe and comfortable.

1. Treat others with **respect and empathy**.
   * Behaviors such as toxicity, gossip, and spreading rumors are unacceptable.
   * When joking with someone, ensure they are comfortable and in on the joke.
2. Maintain a **safe and inclusive** environment.
   * Everyone should feel welcome, regardless of their background or identity.
   * Discrimination, harassment, or any form of exclusion will not be tolerated.
3. Communicate **openly, constructively, and politely**.
   * Encourage healthy discussions and share feedback in a positive manner.
   * Avoid personal attacks and focus on the topic at hand.
   * Do not 'steamroll' conversations.
4. Respect **privacy and confidentiality**.
   * Do not request the personal information of others.
   * Protect the privacy of community members at all times.
5. Be **responsible and accountable**.
   * Own your actions and their impact on others.
   * Apologize if you make a mistake and strive to make amends.

### Privacy

As a general rule, we strongly recommend refraining from sharing _**any**_ personal information online unless you are fully comfortable with those you are interacting with. Additionally, we are careful to remind you that all in-server activity is visible to online and offline moderators, which is one of the reasons why new moderators are appointed via a vote of confidence. These standards cover rules you should follow _anywhere_ online, not just in the Chertia community.

1. Never share private/personal information that could be used against you. It is not up to us if you want to share your given name or general location, but _**never**_ share your surname, exact location or address.
2. Where possible, try not to reveal your age. This is another piece of information that can be used against you. Your age is included in the whitelist application as a way of staff members verifying that you are eligible to play on the server, but it is not shared with others.
3. Do not post images of yourself. Images that you post on the internet are there forever, and Discord itself has a history of ‘forgetting’ to delete cached images - even if you post a message and delete it afterwards, the image that the message contained might stick around for longer than you want it to. Additionally, these kinds of images can be used against you in malicious ways.
4. Do not share deep personal issues in a public forum without being aware of the consequences that may be associated with it. The staff team is always standing by, but there may be circumstances where information can be shared between community members behind our backs.
5. Do not share or joke about sexual preferences in-depth. While you may be comfortable with your sexuality and those involved in the interaction could also be, you always run the risk of a potentially malicious person either using this information against you or picking up on it as an indication of interest.

_**In general, assume that any information you share is now public information. Consider this when you decide what you should and should not post.**_

#### **Interaction & Roleplay** <a href="#interaction-and-roleplay" id="interaction-and-roleplay"></a>

These are some of the warning signs that you should look out for when you are interacting with others in the community and elsewhere online.

1. **Player/character distinctions** are important to be aware of when interacting and roleplaying with others. The actions and thoughts of a character are not representative of the person who is playing that character. This also applies to in-character relationships, which should be separated from out-of-character interactions and relationships.
2. **Peer pressure** is a significant issue no matter what the ages of involved community members are. If you feel as though you are being peer pressured to do something that you are uncomfortable with, you should end the interaction and inform a staff member. There are several ways that someone can try to use peer pressure against you.
   1. **Appeal to empathy**; when someone takes advantage of a person’s empathy to try and get what they want, this is a form of peer pressure, and an especially dangerous one at that. For example, saying something along the lines of “I’ve been feeling really bad lately, but if you did \[x] I might feel a bit better”.
   2. **Lack of boundaries**; someone may overstep their boundary with another person by attempting to make them feel ‘less-than’ for not doing what they want you to do. For example, “oh, come on. It’s me you’re talking to and it’s just \[x]”.
   3. **Creating precedent**; someone might bring up the past actions of the person they are interacting with as a way of trying to get them to do something now. For example, “but you did \[x] last time. Why not now?”
   4. **Using threatening language;** this is the most obvious form of peer pressure, but it is dangerous nonetheless. When someone uses implications or open threats to try and get another person to do something. For example; “if you don’t do \[x] I will \[y].”
3. **Inappropriate comments and messages** can often be difficult to pinpoint because context matters a lot. However, sexually suggestive messages that make you uncomfortable are never okay and should be reported to a staff member immediately, including the context of the message. This applies to both out-of-character and in-character interactions, on and off the server.

### Safety Entitlement

* Members of the community are entitled to a standard of safety enforced by the staff team.
* If a community member or staff member poses a threat to other community members, they will be removed from the community.
