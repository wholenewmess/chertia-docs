# ðŸ“— Survival Standards

### ðŸ“— Main Standards

1. No griefing or stealing.
   * This rule applies to both player-built structures and pre-generated structures (regardless of size).
   * Build at least 32 blocks away from the nearest player or structure.
   * When looting a structure, take only the items inside loot chests (orange text on the chest name). Do not break any blocks or take anything else (including books).
2. When claiming land, you must have immediate intent to build on it. Land that is "claimed" but has no purpose will be considered unclaimed.
   * Be mindful of others' space and immersion; "mega-builds", pixel art, etc. are not permitted unless approved by a moderator.
   * Keep crop farms limited in size.
3. No hacked clients, unapproved mods, or glitch/noise exploits.
4. All mob farms must use approved designs.
   * Automated farms are not allowed.
   * AFK fishing farms are not allowed.&#x20;
5. Chop down an entire tree -- don't leave the stump or top of the tree.
