### ðŸ“— Main Standards

1. No griefing or stealing.
   * When looting a structure, take only the items inside loot chests (orange text on the chest name). Do not break any blocks or take anything else (including books).
2. No hacked clients, unapproved mods, or glitch exploits.
3. All mob farms must use approved designs.
   * Automated farms are not allowed.
   * AFK fishing farms are not allowed.&#x20;
4. Build at least 32 blocks away from the nearest player or structure.
5. When claiming land, you must have immediate intent to build on it. Land that is "claimed" but has no purpose will be considered unclaimed.
6. Chop down an entire tree -- don't leave the stump or top of the tree.
