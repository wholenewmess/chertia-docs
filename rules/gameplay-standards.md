### ⚖️ Punishments <a href="#punishments" id="punishments"></a>

We deal with punishments on a case-by-case basis. Severe or repeated rule violations will result in a ban.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Appeals

If you have received a ban and do not agree with it, you may appeal using our [**appeals form**](https://forms.gle/tf6AQCrLicfhHr1K9). Please send one of us a message once the form is submitted.

Maximum severity bans & some extreme cases cannot be appealed. You will be notified if your ban cannot be appealed. Appeal decisions are final and cannot be appealed again.
