# 📙 Character Standards

### 📙 **Character Standards**

Your character will be rejected if it does not follow these standards.

1. Your character is original (it is not a copy of a character from somewhere else).
2. Your character was created by you. It was not created with AI (ChatGPT, etc.), or created by someone else.
3. Your character is mortal (they can die).
4. Your character comes from a clan or location in Divian (the world we play in). To see which places your character can be from, see the Lore Guide.
5. Your character does not have split or multiple personalities.
6. Your character is not perfect -- give them flaws.
7. Your character does not share a name with you (in any form) and is separate from your real personality.
8. Your character does not have a disability or affliction that may upset or offend players on the server.

### **⚖️ Equality**

We require that your character is not overpowered.

1. Your character does not have items/objects/abilities from outside the current story.
2. Your character does not have special magic or inherent abilities that put them at an advantage over other characters.
3. All aspects of your character are representable in-game (no charms, jewelry, etc. that don't appear as in-game items).

### **✏️ Alterations**

Through the storytellers and moderators, you are able to make changes to and reset your character. You should speak with a storyteller or moderator if you are unhappy with your character.
