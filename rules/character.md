### üìô **Character Standards**

Your character will be rejected if it does not follow these standards.

7. Your character does not share a name with you (in any form) and is separate from your real personality.

### **‚öñÔ∏è Equality**

We require that your character is not overpowered.

1. Your character does not have items/objects/abilities from outside the current story.
2. Your character does not have special magic or inherent abilities that put them at an advantage over other characters.
3. All aspects of your character are representable in-game (no charms, jewelry, etc. that don't appear as in-game items).

### **‚úèÔ∏è Alterations**

Through the storytellers and moderators, you are able to make changes to and reset your character. You should speak with a storyteller or moderator if you are unhappy with your character.
