# ðŸŒ• Player Government

The player government is flexible and can be changed with votes. Here is how it currently works.

### ðŸ‘¥ Clans

The characters can form **clans**. These clans typically consist of like-minded individuals with common goals and aspirations. Clans can ally with other clans, associate with one of the two warring nations, and more.

### ðŸ’¬ Council

As voted by the characters, each clan with 3 or more members has one 'vote' on the council per 3 clan members. Independents vote in units of 3 as well, with the votes by independents averaged out.
