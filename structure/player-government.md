# 🌕 Player Government

The player government is flexible and can be changed with votes. Here is how it currently works.

### 👥 Clans

The characters can form **clans**. These clans typically consist of like-minded individuals with common goals and aspirations. Clans can ally with other clans, associate with one of the two warring nations, and more.

### 💬 Council

As voted by the characters, each clan with 3 or more members has one 'vote' on the council. Independents vote in units of 3 as well, with the internal majority decision being the vote submitted by the unit.

Voting clans right now are:

* Clemencia
* Moonlight
* Sapphire Light

The council has **no** judicial power. Clans determine their own punishments and can seek out justice if necessary.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Laws

Current laws in place:

* Characters can claim land by building a structure & labelling it with a sign. Building too close to someone else's claim is not permitted.
