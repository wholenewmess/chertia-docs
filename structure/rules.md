### Consequences

You are expected to understand and adhere to the server rules -- ignorance is not an excuse.

<table><thead><tr><th width="216">Consequence Type</th><th width="352">Result</th><th data-type="checkbox">Can be appealed?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Light warning</td><td>Staff member reminds you to abide by the rules. No consequence is added to your account.</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Warning</td><td>Staff member reminds you to abide by the rules; a consequences is added to your account for a period of 60 days.</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Mute</td><td>You are muted temporarily, for a period of time left to staff discretion.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Temporary ban</td><td>You are temporarily banned from the server and muted on the Discord. Is automatically paired with a warning.</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Permanent ban</td><td>Your account is permanently banned from Chertia.</td><td>true</td></tr></tbody></table>

All consequences are decided on a case-by-case basis involving at least two staff members, at least one of which must be an administrator. In cases where a consequence must be applied quickly but the extent/length of it has not yet been determined, you will receive a "holding ban", which will see you banned from the server for a period of time while we determine your final consequence. You may appeal your case during this time using our appeals form at the bottom of this page. New members will face much higher scrutiny.

Consequences are wiped from your record after 60 days. Note that **having 3 concurrent consequences on your record results in a ban that will last until a time when one of those consequences is wiped**, unless one of them is a permanent ban. Additionally, receiving 3 temporary bans will result in a permanent ban without appeal.

#### **Appeals**

If you have received a consequence and do not agree with it, you may appeal using our [**appeals form**](https://forms.gle/tf6AQCrLicfhHr1K9). Please send one of us a message once the form is submitted.

Severe infringement bans cannot be appealed.
